My hybrid sort uses my random quick sort and will check to see if the partitioned section is <= 10% sorted
if it isnt then it will continue sorting with random quick sort and if it is then it calls insertion sort and
continues on.

My hybrid sort was faster than my random quick sort in every single case and was actually a good bit faster.

(timing values are in nanoseconds if you want them in milliseconds divide time by 1000000)
